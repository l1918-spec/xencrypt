## Features

Xencrypt provides:

- **AMSI bypass** and evasion of modern antivirus solutions (tested on VirusTotal at the time of writing).
- **Compression and encryption** of PowerShell scripts.
- Minimal or **negative performance overhead** (due to compression).
- **Obfuscation** with randomized variable names and decryption stubs.
- **High entropy** through randomized encryption, compression, and statement ordering.
- **Easy customization** for creating your own crypter variant.
- Support for **recursive layering**, tested with up to 500 layers.
- Compatibility with both `Import-Module` and direct execution (as long as the original script supports it).
- Distributed as a **single file**, ensuring portability.
- Licensed under **GPLv3** ‚Äì completely free and open-source!

### Caveat
While Xencrypt is powerful, it‚Äôs not a universal solution for all configurations. **Use at your own risk!**
